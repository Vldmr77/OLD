# Changelog

## [2025-10-25] Stage 1 â€” Risk control alignment kickoff
### Changed
- Refined RiskEngine trailing stop computation to use entry price ratios and the specification's spread floor, ensuring stop adjustments respect position direction and emit precise tighten/closure signals.
- Updated Tinkoff async client helper to only forward gRPC option parameters when configured, keeping compatibility with lightweight stubs used in tests.
### Added
- Introduced `scripts/run_tests.sh` as the canonical pytest runner for local and CI executions, enabling consistent invocation across stages.
### Fixed
- Adjusted unit tests to assert sandbox target prefixes rather than legacy sentinel values so they remain compatible with real endpoint strings.
